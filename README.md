# Omeka S Tutorial
## A very basic tutorial on Omeka-s  

Welcome to the wonderful world of Omeka S.  This tutorial will provide you with the basic tools you will need to start working with Omeka S.  For this tutorial we recommend that you follow along on one of the [Omeka S Sandbox accounts.](https://omeka.org/s/download/#sandbox)  

#### Step 1 - Make a site
* Log in to Omeka S.  You should arrive at the Dashboard that will look something like this:  
  ![Screenshot 1][scrn1]  
* In the navigation panel on the left click on sites then click "Add new site" in the top right corner.  
  ![Screenshot 2][scrn2]  
* On this page you will add a title for your page.  You can also add a URL slug if you want.  If you you leave this field blank Omeka S will simply make one for you based on the title you chose.

* Next click on the Theme tab.  Here we will choose what theme suits our need best.  It is possible to add more Themes than the basic four but for now we will simply choose Center Row.

* For now we will ignore the Item Set tab and click the Add button in the top right corner to create our site.  

#### Step 2 - Items  
* Now that we have a site we need items to add to it.  Items in Omeka S are not the simple files that you may be used to working with.  Omeka S allows you to add all sorts of metadata to each item so it might be helpful to think of items in Omeka S as a collection of metadata referencing a central topic.  To make a new item start by clicking on the "Items" button under the "Resourses" heading in the navigation menu.  Here you will see a list of all the items that can be used by your sites.  Click the "Add new item" button in the top right corner.  
* Now we need to add data to our item.  When making a new item generally the first thing you want to do is select a resource template.  The Sandbox has pre-made resource templates covering most broad topics.  **You do not need to select a resource template, they are simply a tool that allows you to make multiple items that have the same properties more easily.**  For this example we are going to select "Person" from the resource template list.  Selecting a resource template will automatically choose the class and add all of the properties that are relevant to that type of resource.  
* Next we need to select a class for our item.  If you selected "Person" from the resource template drop down the the class should be "Friend of a Friend: Person".  If not then select the drop down, scroll down to the Friend of a Friend section and select Person.  Choosing an accurate class for your item is important because later on it will allow you to group similar items together more easily.
* Now we add properties to our item.  There are more than one-hundred different properties that you can add to your items using the default Vocabularies that come with Omeka S.  By default you will have the Title and Description properties on your item.  If you selected the person template then you will intead have the properties below.
