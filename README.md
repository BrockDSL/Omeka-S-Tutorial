# Omeka S Tutorial
## A very basic tutorial on Omeka-s  

Welcome to the wonderful world of Omeka S.  This tutorial will provide you with the basic tools you will need to start working with Omeka S.  For this tutorial we recommend that you follow along on one of the [Omeka S Sandbox accounts.](https://omeka.org/s/download/#sandbox)  Keep in mind that these accounts wipe all data a few times per week as they are meant for demo use only.

#### Step 1 - Plan your site
Before you start making a site with Omeka S it is important to plan out what your site will be about.  Think about what resources you want to have on your site and try to think of a term that best describes you sites theme.  For this tutorial the theme will be Canadian Prime Ministers.  

#### Step 2 - Make an Item Set
* Log in to Omeka S.  You should arrive at the Dashboard that will look something like this:  
  ![Screenshot 1][scrn1]  
* From the navigation menu on the left side click on "Item Sets" under the "Resources" heading.
* Click on the "Add new item set" button in the top right corner.
* Item sets tie all of your resources together under a single theme.  You can use multiple item sets for a single site but for this tutorial we will just use one.  In the text box for Title write "Canadian Prime Ministers" and in the description box type "My favorite Canadian Prime Ministers".  The other options on this page will be covered in the "Items" section.
* Click the Save button at the top right of the page.

#### Step 3 - Make a Site
* In the navigation panel on the left click on "Sites" then click "Add new site" in the top right corner.  
  ![Screenshot 2][scrn2]  
* On this page you will add a title for your page.  Type Canadian Prime Ministers into the title field.  You can also add a URL slug if you want.  If you you leave the slug field blank Omeka S will simply make one for you based on the title you chose.

* Next click on the Theme tab.  Here we will choose what theme suits our need best.  It is possible to add more Themes than the basic four but for now we will simply choose Center Row.

* Lastly go to the Item pool tab.  Here we will just change the value in the "Search by item set" box to our "Canadian Prime Ministers" item set.  Click the Add button in the top right corner to crete our site.

#### Step 4 - Items  
* Now that we have a site we need items to add to it.  Items in Omeka S are not the simple files that you may be used to working with.  Omeka S allows you to add all sorts of metadata to each item so it might be helpful to think of items in Omeka S as a collection of metadata referencing a central topic.  To make a new item start by clicking on the "Items" button under the "Resourses" heading in the navigation menu.  Here you will see a list of all the items that can be used by your sites.  Click the "Add new item" button in the top right corner.  
* Now we need to add data to our item.  When making a new item generally the first thing you want to do is select a resource template.  The Sandbox has pre-made resource templates covering most broad topics.  **You do not need to select a resource template, they are simply a tool that allows you to make multiple items that have the same properties more easily.**  For this example we are going to select "Person" from the resource template list.  Selecting a resource template will automatically choose the class and add all of the properties that are relevant to that type of resource.  
* Next we need to select a class for our item.  If you selected "Person" from the resource template drop down the the class should be "Friend of a Friend: Person".  If not then select the drop down, scroll down to the Friend of a Friend section and select Person.  Choosing an accurate class for your item is important because later on it will allow you to group similar items together more easily.
* Now we add properties to our item.  There are more than one-hundred different properties that you can add to your items using the default Vocabularies that come with Omeka S.  By default you will have the Title and Description properties on your item.  Using the panel on the right side you can search for different properties from the vocabularies you have access to.  For this example we are making a person our item so we would want properties like Name, Brief Biography, Date of Birth, etc.  If you selected the "Person" template then these properties will have been selected for you as shown below.  Feel free to add any other properties you think may be relevant by using the menu on the right.

* Next we will describe each property using values.  Each property can be defined using any number of values, in any combination and quantity of three types.  This can be confusing so we will break it down.  The three values that can be used to define a property are Text, Omeka Resource, and URI.  For each property you select one or more value types by clicking the button for it on the property's bar.  Text values are simply text added to a text box describing the property, Omeka Resources are other items or item sets in Omeka that you want to use to describe the current property, URI's are usually website URL's that lead to pages that describe the property.  For now we will just use text values and we will use Sir John A. Macdonald as our subject.

* Click on the media tab.  Here we can add media that helps define our item subject.  This is where you can add images and files, websites, HTML content, IIIF images via URL, oEmbed URL's, and videos from YouTube.  Feel free to add any content you like.  
* Next is the Item sets tab.  **This is important**.  From the menu on the right side find the item set we made at the start of the tutorial and select it.  This will allow us to easily connect the items we want to our site and exclude unwanted items.  
* Lastly is the mapping tab.  Here we can select a location that is relevant to our subject.  For Sir John A. Macdonald you could select his home country of Scotland, his grave site, the parliment building in Ottowa, or any other relevant locations.  Once you are done click Add in the top right corner.
* You can repeat this process for any other items that you think would be relevant.
