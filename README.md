# Omeka S Tutorial
## A very basic tutorial on Omeka-s  

Welcome to the wonderful world of Omeka S.  This tutorial will provide you with the basic tools you will need to start working with Omeka S.  For this tutorial we recommend that you follow along on one of the [Omeka S Sandbox accounts.](https://omeka.org/s/download/#sandbox)  

#### Step 1 - Make a site
* Log in to Omeka S.  You should arrive at the Dashboard that will look something like this:  
  ![Screenshot 1][scrn1]  
* In the navigation panel on the left click on sites then click "Add new site" in the top right corner.  
  ![Screenshot 2][scrn2]  
* On this page you will add a title for your page.  You can also add a URL slug if you want.  If you you leave this field blank Omeka S will simply make one for you based on the title you chose.

* Next click on the Theme tab.  Here we will choose what theme suits our need best.  It is possible to add more Themes than the basic four but for now we will simply choose Center Row.
